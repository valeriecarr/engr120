 world, appreciate creativity, punctuality, find the good in things,

 be eaten, and, welp, strive to be the kind of person dogs think
 their owners are.<br />
 <br />
 and if you slip once in awhile? that's ok, too.<br />
 <br />
 i'm a scientist, and i've taken a new job that has me situated in
 the lower 48, new to the bay area (and online dating). much of my
 job is running around in a little boat mapping the seafloor,
 creating nautical charts. i respond to whatever ruffles up the
 water or lurks underneath threatening safe navigation, too. i
 really like water, and am thankful to live near it, work on it, and
 play over / under, inside out of it.<br />
 <br />
 i didn't take the usual route in life. i'm a journeyman. i've been
 a bunch of places, enjoyed a few adventures; been there and back
 again. i am proud that i'm not a wishy-washy guy that talks about
 what he would like to do, what could be, what's over the
 rainbow.<br />
 <br />
 nope. i get it done. i am.<br />
 <br />
 i've paid my dues, worked my way through school for a computer
 science degree, and then topped it off with some graduate work in
 remote sensing. after college i promptly toughed it up in alaska
 for ten years working in the field, three of which living off the
 grid in a floating cabin, and another four serving aboard a 321
 foot ship conducting hydrographic survey.<br />
 <br />
 i ended up a working professional, responsible for expensive things
 and trusted with the safety of others.<br />
 <br />
 my friends tell me to mention that i can ride a unicycle and juggle
 at the same time. they say girls dig that, but my circustry is a
 deeply personal thing -- like maybe something i might do on the
 fourth date.<br />
 <br />
 lastly, i grew up with artist parents who encouraged creativity. to
 this day i appreciate the simple joy of making things. i draw a lot
 -- mostly cartoons. i've drawn hundreds of them, most published in
 odd rural alaskan papers or scientific journals. i make music, too,
 but not very well. basically i understand creativity is a big part
 of life, and frivolous, joyful expression is just as important as
 all the serious scientific mumbo jumbo i surround myself with
 daily.<br />

 an introduction. i feel like time's a wasting -- and there's so
 much more to do! let's chat soon.",kickin' butt.,"being noticed. it's like an unwanted super power. maybe it's just

f,straight,has cats,white,41-45,graduated from college/university,sometimes,64,80000,other,2012-06-28-22-03,"san rafael, california",doesn&rsquo;t want kids,buddhism but not too serious about it,no,fit,aquarius and it&rsquo;s fun to think about,"english, english",single,strictly anything,rarely,"hi there,<br />
 <br />
 i will do my best here to offer you a snapshot, or perhaps even a
 zoom-in view of myself and my world. i do this knowing that there
 is no substitute for what happens in real life - you know, like
 when two people are close enough to actually sense each
 other.<br />
 i do know that engaging in live, two-way conversation feels much
 more real to me than describing myself to you this way, but here
 goes.<br />
 <br />
 my friends describe me as passionate, playful, expressive, and
 adventurous. i'm all about my next adventure and i have a big
 appetite for life. i aim for a combination of routine and
 spontaneity in my day to day.<br />
 i'm fortunate to posses a natural buoyancy toward life. i've
 cultivated that by being pretty vigilant about watching my mind and
 not necessarily believing the stories it likes to generate. there's
 often quite a gap between 'story' and 'reality'. as byron katie
 likes to say: ""reality is always kinder than the story we tell
 ourselves about it.""<br />
 <br />
 i get along great with kids because i still have a lot of kid left
 inside me, but i have also graduated to full adult-hood. i pay my
 bills on time and don't make too many messes in life. (well maybe
 some intentional ones, like when i'm finger painting with chocolate
 pudding)<br />
 if i like something, more is good, if not, there's plenty else to
 try.<br />
 i love being a girl and all that it entails. whether that means
 dressing up for a special event, or having full access to my
 emotions, i wouldn't trade it. having a reason to dress up is a big
 pleasure, i also like a day in my pj's every now and then.<br />
 <br />
 i especially enjoy the unique polarity of masculine and feminine,
 it's such a rich and unique alchemy. what i'm drawn to in a a man
 is his quiet confidence and his depth of presence. someone who's
 comfortable enough in himself that he doesn't need to pretend,
 posture, or impress, but can simply be the man that he is. secure
 enough that when he's feeling something he can share it honestly.
 at home in his body and naturally affectionate. extra plus if
 you're familiar with tantra and/or taoist practice.<br />
 <br />
 my vision for my next relationship is one that is very dynamic,
 engaged, and a lot of fun. i'm drawn to connecting with those who
 are relatively free from the residue of their past so are free to
 live, act, and make decisions from today.<br />
 we all have shadow, and one of it's favorite places to show itself
 is in deeper relationship, but when there is space to welcome that,
 and even curiosity about it, i find it moves along pretty
 quickly.<br />
 <br />
 i keep discovering that what matters most, is less about what i'm
 getting, than how i'm contributing, and i strive to have a positive
 impact whenever i can.<br />
 i'm definitely an extrovert since i really enjoy people, i also
 need some down time to hang with myself.<br />
 <br />
 although i love children, i'm probably not looking to have any, but
 i sure like playing with them. i wouldn't rule out relationship
 with you if you're a dad, so long as you've also got time and space
 for another significant relationship in your life.","spending time with my friends.<br />

 willy wonka and the chocolate factory a close second<br />

 more to learn.<br />
 go through cycles of reading novels, lately mostly when on vacation
 and long plane rides. i'd subscribe to the new yorker if it came
 monthly, not weekly. otherwise they just end up in a pile, waiting
 to be read and then out-dated. one day...<br />

 favorite ways to slow down, savor, and relax. one of the great

 a few candid tidbits about me:<br />
 <br />
 personally and spiritually, i am a giving person. i always look for
 opportunities to connect people to people or resources. i learned
 years ago that money is not the only medium of exchange in life. i
 am kind, honest, loving and resourceful. i stick my neck out for
 people who i think highly of, and often for those i barely know.
 that is my calling card.<br />
 <br />
 i was formerly an executive at a few different investment firms in
 sf. i left to get a life. now i'm back in the financial world on a
 smaller scale giving practical advice to those who need and
 sometimes appreciate it.<br />
 <br />
 a recent acquaintance called me ""blonde jedi."" that feels about
 right. i'll own it. yet i am equal parts smarty-pants and gullible
 idealist.<br />
 <br />
 i'm a member of a couple of lineage societies, because <a class=
 ""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=genealogy"">genealogy</a> is so sexy and
 i know that's what will win you over about me. other, less unusual
 passions: <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=cooking"">cooking</a>,

 ""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=bossing%0aaround+contractors"">bossing
 around contractors</a>, &amp; <a class=""ilink"" href=
 ""/interests?i=small+writing+projects"">small writing projects</a>.
 if you would teach me how to take better digital photos, i will be
 your best friend. i am competent on the foredeck of your <a class=
 ""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=sailboat"">sailboat</a>, but don't ask me
 to go camping....i have hiked all over italy and france, and would
 love to do similar trips with a partner in the future. i love
 hiking through beautiful landscapes, and then looking forward to a
 michelin ** meal at the end of the day.<br />
 <br />
 i usually get the guy, not because i'm ""all that"" but because i
 have confidence and i genuinely like men. i have a modicum of charm
 and wit, and i love when men find this attractive, esp. if you have
 these qualities in abundance. (btw, i am hoping you have these in
 abundance, and a wicked sense of humor. that is soooooo sexy.) i
 love it when men know 20 fun things to do that don't require a
 cent. i so admire ingenuity. i equally enjoy *high brow*~<br />
 <br />
 having quality relationships is the priority for me at this point
 in my life. i am tactful, but no shy violet. you can count on the
 conversation being playful, and on my teasing you about whatever
 seems to get your goat. i prefer to be dating an extroverted
 communicator type of guy.<br />
 <br />
 my best job and best decision so far was to have my daughter. she
 is my raison d'etre. but i definitely have room for more raison
 d'etres. total bonus if you are kind to children and they actually
 like you.<br />
 <br />
 i wear a size 12, 36dd and am not interested in someone who wants a
 waifish girl. there are many other girls on cupid who will match
 you better.) you want to date me because i'm firing on all burners
 and am strong-witted. that said, i generally prefer fit men. from
 my past history, i can say that i sincerely don't have a type,
 other than common traits: brainy, eclectic, honest, sincere,
 well-intended. <strong>sterling character.</strong>","i am daring to bring all of the elements together:enough time,
 resources, and energy to have fun, have hobbies, enjoy close
 relationships with the ones i love, realizing that all we have is
 now. i don't live to work.<br />
 <br />
 short version: i live in kensington (north berk), and spend some
 weekends in nevada city (gold country). i live with my two 1/2 year
 old girl, an au pair from overseas, and two cats. we tend to travel
 as a pack. we're headed to vegas, san diego &amp; hawaii later this
 year. wish i could travel to farther locales, and hoping to do so
 with a great man!","listening. people tell me things. i love the sordid, most
 interesting things that should only be spoken in the ""cone of
 silence."" you can trust me. i will absolutely keep it there. tell
 me......your secrets.","i have a big ch'i, and i'm not afraid to use it.","recent faves: at home by bill bryson - hilarious, somewhat obscure.

 (feel free to skip over the section on books, films, food, etc. or
 any other section for that matter)<br />
 <br />
 generally speaking, i am very content with myself and my life, yet
 i miss that special magic that two people can create together; and
 i really miss sharing the journey through life, and all the little
 and big ways that a relationship adds to my life.<br />
 <br />
 on first dates, i'm often told that i'm really easy to talk with
 and very easy to be with. i suppose this is largely because i've
 grown quite comfortable with myself and who i am. i've worked on
 myself a lot for over 3 decades, and, while still/always a
 work-in-progress, i've come a long way in myself and in my life.
 i'm happy and i enjoy life. also, i have a lot of interests, i
 listen well and converse easily. i'm very curious about people and
 mostly non-judgmental.<br />
 <br />
 those that know me describe me as very kind, feminine, extremely
 sweet, soft yet strong, gentle and firm, very present, calm,
 grounded, compassionate, lively, passionate, insightful, relaxed,
 very affectionate, interesting, super bright, curious, funny,
 multi-talented and creative, nurturing, generous, fun, and
 spontaneous...... though usually not all in the same sentence. i'm
 intense at times, but in a good way.<br />
 men often ask me how it's possible that i'm unattached. those that
 know me really well would add that i'm wise, exceptionally
 sensitive, intuitive, and a bit of a sprite. you'll know i'm
 comfortable with you when you get to experience the sprite in me.
 :)<br />
 <br />
 i have a huge heart and love full out. hopefully, you do too.
 that's where the 2heartsdelight happens. you'd need to be ok with
 being loved completely.<br />
 <br />
 i have a very curious mind. i ask a lot of questions- not all of
 them aloud. i'm told i ask great questions.<br />
 and, i don't have a need to always have conversation in the company
 of another. i'm fine with just being especially once we know each
 other a bit and are comfortable with each other.<br />
 <br />
 i've developed awfully good communication skills and excellent
 relationship skills. men in recent years have found me rather
 remarkable in this way and in other ways too. i hold up my end of a
 partnership/relationship rather well and can let you have your
 experience w/o getting reactive and can manage my own experience
 w/o needing to process it with you. ideally, you're able to do the
 same. i'm past the point of needing to process a bunch of stuff in
 relationships. hopefully you are too. we'll process only that which
 needs to be processed together; the rest we'll each handle on our
 own. let's enjoy sharing the journey. harmony in relationship is
 absolutely paramount to me; life is short.<br />
 <br />
 i'm a long time student (over 23 years) of the diamond approach in
 the ridhwan school and also of yoga.<br />
 i have very very high integrity.<br />
 i almost always take the high road- even in the worst of
 times.<br />
 i'm iconoclastic, autodidactic, and very self-aware.<br />
 <br />
 i live on the edge or beyond the edge of my comfort zone most of
 the time: my soul is on some sort of fast track. the rate of
 growth/transformation can be quite rapid; it's kind of out of my
 hands. i don't expect you to be like me in this regard, but you
 should know and understand this and be ok with it. i am not your
 average bear.<br />
 <br />
 i'm realistic and i'm optimistic.<br />
 i no longer sweat the small stuff and most things really are small
 stuff.<br />
 <br />
 i am an independent thinker and think waaaay outside the box.
 visionary, creative, progressive,.....you get the idea.<br />
 <br />
 my life is very full and fairly well-balanced; and i have plenty of
 time for the right man. in fact, it's a high priority for me to
 make time for a great man and create a great relationship
 together.<br />
 <br />
 my spiritual life is quite significant, but the form is not rigid.
 i'm happier hiking, gardening, singing kirtan and bhajans, or going
 to a yoga class (all of those are spiritual for me) than going to
 church or temple although i can enjoy that too on occasion. my
 orientation to life is spiritual, has been my entire life and is
 well-integrated into my being so it's not critical for me to do
 spiritual things.<br />
 <br />
 i'm quite self-sufficient, but much prefer partnership. i've gone
 from being super-competent, ultra-independent, feminist,
 do-everything-myself to being able to kindly ask for help,
 graciously accept it when it's offered, and be a feminine
 participant in the relationship. i'm very generous with the many
 feminine skills i possess. an ideal relationship for me has lots of
 mutual lavishing. interesting how when there's a lot of lavishing,
 there are very few issues....... :)<br />
 <br />
 i know how to really accept another unconditionally and appreciate
 another fully. our chances for a really harmonious relationship
 increase tremendously if the same is true for you.<br />
 <br />
 while having shared interests is nice, what is more important to me
 in a partner are kindness, self-acceptance, passion, respect,
 devotion to the relationship, personal responsibility, generosity,
 humor, lightness, fun, passion, honesty and openness. i offer all
 of these too.<br />
 <br />
 i'm really comfortable with my sexuality as well as my libido. i'm
 also super affectionate and am extremely cuddly. if you are too,
 this could be delightful.<br />
 <br />
 i'm active physically, love to hike, skate, walk, x/c ski, downhill
 too, snowshoe, swim, snorkel, love to dance- pretty much any kind
 of dance. if you'd be willing to take partner dance lessons, i'd be
 thrilled!<br />
 i don't do any intense gym workouts, rock climb or do xtreme
 sports. and i'm not interested in competition.<br />
 <br />
 i also enjoy quiet indoor time reading, writing, movies, sitting in
 front of the fire, and hanging out together, doing domestic stuff,
 cooking together, baking alone or together.<br />
 <br />
 i'm told that although i'm quite mature, i have a youthfulness and
 appearance younger than my years. for this reason (and a few
 others), i stated my age 3 years younger than actual. people
 usually don't believe me when i tell them my age. really.<br />
 <br />
 wrt the okc enneagram test, i am an unconventional 9 with an 8
 wing; i am not an 8. i'd especially love to hear from men who are
 well-integrated 6s.<br />

 where do i start. okay, i am a simple human being, yet with a deep
 soul, who has a heart of gold and who believes in fairy tales.
 however, i also believe that the pillars of any successful
 relationship are understanding, loyalty, honesty, compromise, the
 will to make things work, communication and respect. i believe in
 fate too and that people meet for a purpose of higher nature and
 that there is a reason for everything.<br />
 <br />
 i have waited and continue to wait for my ""dream girl"" and don't
 mind waiting my whole life for her. i have promised myself to stay
 single and not to marry for the sake of being married only; i will
 marry when i fall madly in love with that special woman who will
 make my heart miss a beat every time i see her or even just think
 of her. just to clarify, my ""dream girl"" is not a model via the way
 she looks, because looks alone does not define my ""dream girl"".
 also, i am not going to make a long list of all the things she
 should be. if i did that, then i might miss a really good woman.
 however, for simplicity sake, i would say that i like the woman who
 is loyal, romantic, sweet, compassionate, sincere, genuine and who
 honors, nurtures and/or takes care of her mind, body and
 soul.<br />
 <br />
 by knowing me, you would discover that i am genuine, a true
 gentleman, compassionate, romantic, loyal and faithful, sensitive,
 introvert to some degree, humble and down to earth. i dislike with
 passion those who play games or those who lie and cheat. i am not
 into one night stand, never was and never will be. watching the
 rainbow and hearing a laughing child make me happy; they re-enforce
 my hope in everything good in life. when it comes to dealing with
 people, i am a strong believer in the saying, treat people as you
 like to be treated. oh, and i love poetry (write when inspired) and
 good dark chocolate (with almonds and/or strawberries yet
 better).<br />
 <br />
 i love walking, enjoy long distance driving and beginning to play
 tennis once again after a long layoff.<br />

 it's so cliche to cover the bases of contradictions; but i've been
 having a lot of self-reflection time lately, and i really am a
 generalist and a centrist in many ways. i actually do try to be all
 things and everything as much as any one person can. i'm a
 do-gooder volunteer and a joiner. i'm a leader and a follower.
 architect by day, security personnel by night. i'm constantly
 looking to learn new things and am usually on the go, but i also
 have no problem lounging on the couch watching an entire television
 series season in one weekend (lately it's been the new doctorwho).
 i am intense and take myself seriously at work.<br />
 <br />
 i really like cats but they are constantly trying to kill me; dogs
 too (oh allergies).<br />
 <br />
 i hold friendships forever; you have to do something really awful
 and unredeemable to lose my friendship. i'm lucky to still live
 near my parents but i don't see them very often.<br />
 <br />
 i've traveled some, near and far -- last summer i was in eastern
 europe (germany, italy, hungary and the countries the for a time
 was known as yugoslavia). i would like to travel so much more and
 keep a running list of places to go and that list is quite long --
 it's a question of money more than it is a question of time or
 desire. i am well-traveled in the us -- i'm about 75% complete on
 my goal of seeing all 50 states. i think much more highly of
 world-travelers if they have also traveled well in their own
 country. it is important, valuable and worth the expense to travel
 in the world, but if you don't accept and know what is important
 and valuable about your own country (especially one as big as the
 us) what's the point?","lately i am all over the place -- growing myself personally
 (learning to speak italian, seeing live music, spending quality
 time with old friends); growing myself professionally (stretching

 a year (usually around 80-100) and try to read a new book every
 month. i don't like to repeat either so i don't have old standards.
 i am not one of those women who wants to re-read jane eyre every
 year, though i do enjoy a good bronte story. my favorite book read
 in the last few years is the path of minor planets by andrew sean
 greer. the public library is my new best friend.<br />
 <br />
 i am always seeking out new restaurants and am usually successful
 at convincing others to try them with me. i also have favorite sf
 chefs that i will follow to various restaurants as they move around
 the city. my friends call me the ""ambassador of delicious"".","my calendar, my phone, a good book, (though not things per se) my
 friends, a cozy sweatshirt, and sunglasses.","lately it has been about professional development and what is the
 next milestone of my career, the idiocy of the populace, traveling
 and how to afford the next trip (and how to narrow down all the
 places i want to go so i can select where to go next -- this time),
 why didn't i like chris eccelston but do like david tennant. does
 the question posed in pulp fiction by uma thurman's character still
 hold true: are there two kinds of people in the world? -- those who
 like elvis and those who like the beatles? and which one am i? (and
 this is really how my stream of consciousness goes)","likely having dinner with a group of friends, staying in with a
 movie or a book, working at the music club as security, still at
 happy hour with my co-workers, or on a plane to visit friends in
 another city","i've somehow been to comic or alternative press conventions in two
 different cities, unintentionally, and enjoyed them.<br />

 reveals a great deal about me and qualities that i value (or at
 least attempt to cultivate) in myself ..let's talk about
 you.<br />
 <br />
 you're a man comfortable in his own skin, who operates from a place
 of authenticity acts get old, but you are more interesting than any
 facade. you're adaptable and flexible yet apply a strong sense of
 integrity to your interpersonal relationships. you understand that
 communication is key to mutual understanding and hang in there even
 when there is conflict. you've got your life together but aren't
 afraid to make some shifts for the right person. you're open to the
 possibility of a relationship (note: if you are looking for
 something not in the context of relationship i think the search
 tools on this site can help you locate that. it isn't here.)<br />
 <br />
 you're emotionally mature but youthful in outlook....dancing,
 music, painting, cooking...you enjoy your creative outlets. you're
 curious about the world, able to entertain lots of ideas,
 cosmologies and theories without needing to proselytize - most
 people walk around with their minds all made up....but for you, on
 some issues the jury is still out.<br />
 <br />
 you consider yourself intelligent, educated, respectful,
 considerate of others' feelings, a man with good boundaries who can
 articulate what they are.<br />
 <br />
 you know how to have fun, laugh and step out a little beyond your
 comfort zone in the spirit of adventure. you're a great
 storyteller, love entertaining and being entertained.<br />
 <br />
 you are resolved with your past. you won't spend our first date (or
 first few dates) telling me all about your ex wife, her vocation,
 favorite cuisine etc. (yes, that should seem obvious but you'd be
 surprised.) we've all been there - but with you your ex is
 emotional history and not a current event.<br />

 nodding, yep, sounds like me... then i'd like to hear from
 you.<br />

 we're not conventional but are pretty traditional in our female/
 male roles. we love the idea of having another female presence in
 our dynamic; beyond the practicality of the situation, it would be
 a great way to experience life. plus, if you're around her size
 your wardrobe just doubled, and if you're a voracious reader, your
 library just tripled ;)<br />
 <br />
 we're really close with our families and friends. we like to have
 intellectual discussions, toss around ideas, stay fit and be
 outdoors, travel, learn new cultures, find our new favorite
 restaurants, develop our projects, and gardening. we definitely
 enjoy the finer things in life. it would be wonderful to meet a

 interests, and is excited to explore the possibilities.","us: we plan on moving to hawaii together at the end of the year (as

 design degree. i want to design scarves with naughty motifs on

 friends together for dinner parties and dancing. i'm very feminine
 and playful; i love dressing up, wearing hats, and vintage clothes
 from the 40s, 50s and early 60s. i enjoy visiting museums and
 attending discussions on politics, society, and the arts. i'm one

 sexually i've been with women and really enjoyed it though i've

 bit, it's something i have thought about since i was young but only
 recently found a man that wants the same thing and is strong enough
 to make it work.<br />
 <br />
 him: i grew up in the wine country of northern california.
 surrounded by beautiful lands, great food and wine, and an amazing
 family. at 17 i made a plan and at 18 i joined the military. after
 a few years in the marine corps, i wanted to attend a school that
 would challenge my beliefs and perception of life and chose the
 university of san francisco. after a great college experience i
 made the decision to transfer to the army. this was based on my
 anticipation of having a family and the quality and scope of the
 services that the marines could not provide for them. at the
 beginning of this year i (finally) accomplished everything i set
 out to do for my first major milestone: provide my own way through
 college, get a degree in international relations, have enlisted
 experience, and ultimately become an infantry officer. hawaii was
 not part of the plan, just icing on the cake. in the future i will
 get my masters and most likely start my own business.<br />
 <br />
 in my personal life i am an old fashioned type, i believe in
 chivalry and the traditional roles of a competent man and a capable
 woman (women.) i love learning new things, developing skills that
 can open more doors to unique experiences (pilot's/glider license,
 scuba, skydive, wilderness survival, sailing and the list goes on)
 i have traveled a great deal both for work and pleasure, as well as
 lived in brasil for several months on my own accord, and i treasure
 the life-long friends i have made along the way.<br />
 <br />
 last, and most importantly, i have had the great fortune of meeting
 a woman that compliments me perfectly, who challenges me to think
 about things that i never would have without her, adding new layers
 to life i had not yet seen and most likely never would. we both
 look forward to meeting an amazing woman who has just as much to
 offer and a similar desire to grow herself.","communicating, finding something fun to do, staying fit, being

 <br />
 if i'm working they might notice my ease in picking up heavy boxes
 of vegetables, or my friendly smile. it's usually the hair though.","food- i eat well. i have constant access for high quality organic
 fruits, veggies, meats, and milk. i eat healthy food as well as
 fats and sugars. i'm not afraid of bacon or marshmallows. at home i
 wind up making something seasonal and quick for myself, and make
 large cuts of meat usually about once a week (braises, roasts,
 rotisserie chicken). when i go out it's usually japanese, korean,
 thai, vietnamese or cambodian...or brunch/breakfast.<br />
 <br />
 music- bob marley, u2, kim hiorthioy, the police, cake, four tet,
 morcheeba, pearl jam, primus..and many many more<br />
 <br />
 books- sci-fi by arthur c. clarke, cook books. i really don't read
 much anymore, and the usual book i'll pick up is on technique..most
 likely on food these days<br />
 <br />
 movies- sci-fi / fantasy movies, romantic comedies, dramas,
 animated things..pixar or anime. nothing by woody allen or will
 ferrel.<br />
 <br />
 shows- i'm always getting sucked into shows on netfilx..dexter,
 doctor who, prison break, eureka, white collar, drop dead diva, and
 i'm a little ashamed to admit it, but i did enjoy desperate
 housewives. and i always love a good cartoon...south park,
 simpsons, samurai 7, samurai champloo, princess tutu, ranma, full
 metal alchemist etc.","-high quality organic food<br />

 i'm here looking for the real thing, a very long term relationship.
 to catch my interest, you should be intelligent and passionate
 about something. i do have a different schedule than most, so
 you'll need to be ok without seeing me on the weekends. i like to
 cuddle a lot, hopefully you do too. basically i'm looking for a
 tall, handsome, intelligent, well-rounded guy that enjoys learning
 about how things work, good food, the outdoors, and treats me well.
 it also doesn't hurt if you're interested in many different things.
 if this sounds like you, we'll probably get along. i'm not
 interested in hippies, hipsters, or people that go to events like
 burning man. i'm also not interested in anyone who believes in god
 or is religious in any way."

 <br />
 walking a cobblestone street (somewhere near or far) to where
 you've been lured, you feel happy for (even though you've been
 swayed away from work you love) in your arm is the woman you adore
 and who adores you. together, you smile and laugh feeling both
 pleasure and contentment to be in each other's company. your shared
 curiosity, explorers' spirit, good humor and zeal for the outdoors
 make traveling and simply living every-day life together a
 delight.<br />
 her paradoxical qualities both bewilder and enchant you. smiling,
 you recall when you first met. her unassuming style, pretty smile,
 authenticity, physical charms and whimsical tendencies distracted
 you from the full depth and intricacies of her total person. still,
 her charisma and the emotion you felt baffled you and compelled you
 to pursue and, much to your good fortune, win her attentions and
 affection.<br />
 in doing so, you pleasantly discovered her youthful, sexy,
 fanciful, nave, affable qualities in coexistence with her
 courageous, mature, intellectual character unafraid to speak her
 mind that challenges and inspires you to be your better self.
 analogous to you, she also loves adventure and has developed
 eclectic-sophisticated predilections for music, the arts and the
 fine distinct things and pleasure of life which she enjoys. yet,
 she fancies simple pleasures and beauty as much as fine things and
 is a humble, sensible person who doesn't require or allow status
 symbols to define her and who endeavors to make a difference in the
 world.<br />
 like you, she is not perfect but she holds herself to high
 standards, has a strong sense of responsibility, and demonstrates a
 notable level of emotional maturity and stability. in this way, she
 is her own person. no matter the modern day craze, peer pressure or
 life struggles, she consistently strives to live a life with
 intention and in harmony with her old-fashion values and
 fundamental nature. in like manner, she strives to be more
 spiritual than religious both attending sunday mass and chanting
 for world peace (calls herself zen-catholic).<br />
 her flexible, calm nature and open mind help you feel at ease and
 free to share your deepest thoughts, ideas and life dreams without
 fear of judgment or rejection of you as a person. her loyalty and
 dedication to family and friends and her love of children mirrors
 that of yours and when things get too crazy she reminds you to stop
 and smell the flowers and that, ultimately, the memories and the
 kind of relationships we build with our family and friends are what
 matter most.<br />
 as your years together pass like days, you continue to discern new
 aspects of her intricate spirit and like that she is still a lady
 who welcomes and embraces your thoughtful respectful, gentleman
 attentions. in settle yet passionate ways, her sensual femininity
 defines your masculinity and provokes you in ways that still stir
 and surprise you as she encourages and surrenders to you gracefully
 accepting your generous, affectionate overtures with delight and
 reciprocity.<br />
 enigmatic as she may seem, she is real. no doubt more intelligent,
 more physically attractive women exist and certainly all is not
 perfect or without effort. but (for you and with you) she is unlike
 any other. no matter her imperfections or occasional blunders (and
 awful off-note singing--lol) with her, life seems to have more
 meaning, more purpose, more pleasure, more passion, more joy, more
 contentment and more serenity...<br />

 i am a native californian (grew up in small agricultural town) who
 loves adventures in the bay area and beyond. i am happy with where
 i am in life but it would be so much more fun if you were in it
 with me!<br />

 i don't take myself too seriously and life is way too short to
 sweat the small stuff. but, relationships with my friends and
 family are extremely important to me. i am a dedicated family
 member and friend with a lot of love to give! i am genuine,
 sincere, and truly care about others. i will always ask about your
 day, and will want to hear all about it. i think honesty is the
 best policy and communication is key. i do my best to live a drama

 exploring is a passion of mine. i've been lucky to see places
 across the globe snorkeling the great barrier reef and driving
 the coast of ireland are some of my favorite experiences. but,

 i'm a san francisco native, which means that most of my friends now
 live in the east bay or somehow remain in the country illegally..

 i am very unamerican for an american. this is due to the fact that
 neither of my parents are from the states. my mexican mother &amp;
 parisian father influenced me into dedicating my youth to playing
 futbol (soccer). through this i had the opportunity to play during
 college, meet some amazing friends and travel a good chunk of the

 catching up on correspondence, outwitting the bunnies, picking up
 after myself, fighting the shades with that one broken spring,
 making plans for life, making plans for death, making dodges to

 my life. i'm a designer and director of user experience at a small

 field). i'm passionate about what i do and making the world a

 dinner parties, and go to movies and events with. i'm looking to
 take the domestication the next level. that said, i'm usually
 referred to as fun and don't want to stop traveling and trying cool
 things. as i mentioned earlier, i'm also starting to change my
 lifestyle and eat right (i'm even considering going paleo) and
 exercise regularly. i've found that as much time as i've spent
 whining and crying on the floor of the gym to my trainer, it's
 still one of the most enjoyable (or maybe rewarding) parts of my
 day.","seriously, how many characters does this thing allow?<br />

 all dessert. not a surprise, really:<br />

 i came to the us from another country twelve years ago. i'm going
 to let you try and work out what country it was. maybe something in
 my profile provides a valuable hint?<br />
 <br />
 the funny accent is still there, but it's fast disappearing.
 admittedly i didn't exactly come from a developing country, but i
 had nothing when i stepped off the plane except what was stuffed
 into my suitcases and a strong desire to be the best that i could
 be here. since i'm not from around these parts, my opinions and
 humor can be a little different to what some may expect.<br />
 <br />
 i also lived in southern california when i first came to the us
 (never again!), and i was fortunate (or unfortunate) enough to live
 in montana for a short period as well. when i was younger, i also
 lived on the island paradise of fiji for a few years.<br />
 <br />
 a recent passion has been learning to dance. for just over a year,
 i've been learning several varieties of ballroom dance including
 cha-cha, foxtrot, hustle, rumba, salsa, swing, tango and waltz. if
 you noticed that those were listed in alphabetical order, then top
 marks to you. by day i'm a meek, mild manner engineer, but at night
 i turn into a dancing machine! it's a great feeling to learn a new
 step, and then to actually execute it well with a partner who
 doesn't know it's coming.<br />
 <br />
 when i'm not dancing, you may find me playing tennis or squash. for
 those that don't know, squash may on first appearances look
 somewhat similar to racquetball, except that racquetball absolutely
 sucks.<br />
 <br />
 my sense of humor is self deprecating, black, and i like mocking
 those in authority and those on high moral ground are all fair
 game.<br />
 <br />
 there are two philosophies that i try to live by. give everyone the
 benefit of the doubt, and if your afraid of something, confront it,
 and overcome that fear.<br />
 <br />
 who am i looking for? i don't have a laundry list. the type of
 person i think i may be most attracted to is probably positive, a
 little adventurous, has a curious mind, and may have been exposed
 to different cultures during her life. bonus points if you can
 dance. double bonus points if you don't have a clue how to dance
 but would like to learn!","* learning to dance the smooth dances including the waltz and the
 foxtrot, the latin dances including the rumba, salsa, tango and
 cha-cha, and the rhythm dances including swing and hustle. i always
 thought it strange that the hustle is considered a latin dance when
 it is obviously associated most closely with disco music. can
 anyone explain that to me?<br />

 always commenting that i'm tall.","* movies/shows: i'm a movie geek. any movie that promotes
 discovery, like 'contact', or 'mission to mars'. movies that
 promote warm fuzzies like 'radio' (what a great movie!). movies
 with good music like 'xanadu', 'moulin rouge' or 'grease'.
 australian movies like 'starstruck', 'gallipoli', 'mad max' and
 'the dish'. sci-fi movies that appeal to my outer (not inner) nerd
 like tron, 'dark city', 'blade runner', 'forbidden planet', 'the
 black hole', 'the andromeda strain', 'logan's run', 'event horizon'
 (this movie seriously scares the shit out of me), 'dune', 'flash
 gordon' (it's soooo campy), and 'stargate'. yes, i really like
 sci-fi movies! movies with explosions. movies with horror. movies
 with awesome intro's like superman. spaghetti westerns like 'the
 good, the bad and the ugly'. tv shows with zombies like 'the
 walking dead'. tv shows with educational content which is pretty
 much anything on the discovery or history channels. old movies like
 'the maltese falcon'. fantasy movies like 'the neverending story',
 'the princess bride'. movies with eye popping visuals like 'the
 fifth element'.<br />
 <br />
 * music: ok, so i'm so not trendy with my musical tastes. i'm stuck
 in the past and i'll admit that. my itunes collection has old
 school disco and soul. chic, crosby stills and nash, deodato, gino

 yellowstone, glacier, yosemite, australia, old photos, old movies,

 now, let's do one of those flashback things...you know, one of
 those corny little blips they do in the movies where the camera
 gets all blurry and a little bit of the person's earlier life story
 gets told.<br />
 <br />
 in elementary school, i was the nerdy tomboy girl in sweatpants
 with thick glasses and frizzed out hair that got teased a lot but
 could still kick your ass in kickball.<br />
 <br />
 in junior high i was the nerdy girl with frizzed out hair and acne
 in contacts who took academics way too seriously, played the flute
 in band, and could kick your ass on a biology test.<br />
 <br />
 in high school, i was the nerdy girl with frizzed out hair who
 wrote for the school paper and kicked my own ass to graduate
 valedictorian.<br />
 <br />
 yeah, yeah, yeah...but what's going on with your life right now?!
 jeez, i'm getting to that. impatient, aren't we?","i graduated from ucla with a ba in psychology in 2011. i worked as
 a research assistant and competed both as a snowboarder and a
 wakeboarder at ucla.<br />
 <br />
 currently, i'm at berkeley taking courses in both their pre-medical
 and literature/writing programs. i'm preparing myself for those 6-8
 years it'll take me to become a physician. i still take academics
 way too seriously but i betcha want me to if i end up your doctor
 one day. :-)","1.) sports: athletic guys are sexy. i'm one of those weirdo females
 who loves sports. take me to a baseball game, give me my greasy
 stadium food. don't call me sundays or monday nights during
 football season. drive me to the beach to frolic around with my
 rescue mutt in the water and i'm set for hours. drop me off with my
 snowboard gear at the top of mammoth and i'm set for days. my best
 friends on my stressful days are my running shoes and my treadmill.
 i'm currently training to improve my 5k time and eventually run a
 10k.<br />
 <br />
 2.) rooting for the my teams: i grew up in southern california. the
 dodgers and angels will always be my home teams. i'm currently
 rooting for new england patriots because admit it, tom brady is bad
 ass. don't bother messaging me if you're one of those silly giants
 fans. hahaha...only half-serious.<br />
 <br />
 3.) hating usc: ucla runs in my blood and i'm a bruin for life.
 therefore, it is my religious duty to despise usc. sorry, trojans
 and their fans, not interested. this time i'm 3/4 serious.
 :-)<br />
 <br />
 4.) being honest: i am physically unable to lie or keep something
 from someone i care for. honestly, i get this nervous feeling in my
 stomach and it's just not worth it. it's gotten me in trouble
 plenty of times (don't ask questions you don't want answered), but
 i won't ever change it.","and exactly how am i supposed to know what <b>other</b> people
 usually notice about me?","these are just a few. i swear, everytime i have to list my
 favorites, they all pack up their bags and head for the bahamas

 <br />
 a.) books: i'm a total bookworm. to name a few recent favorites:
 the help, divergent, still alice, left neglected, the hunger games,
 and the dresden files. i have read the twilight series (relax, i'm
 far from a twihard fan...and i won't count it against you if you
 don't sparkle). i'd be remiss if i didn't mention a few of the
 classics: animal farm, 1984, shakespeare's plays, the old man and
 the sea, to kill a mockingbird, the great gatsby...this could go on
 forever.<br />
 <br />
 b.) movies: i'm a recent addition to the netflix family, and slowly
 working my way through movies everyone has seen except me.<br />
 <br />
 c.) music: i consulted my itunes about this and by the time it
 loaded my more than 32 gigs worth of music, the poor little dude
 let out an exhausted sigh and settled in for a long winter's nap. i
 like basically any music (and when i say that, i do mean it). my
 interests are thoroughly varied.<br />

 once...why not? if i don't like it, my taste buds are entirely
 capable of giving it the old pat-o-ee.","1.) family<br />

 completely different position than i expected. it hasn't been easy,

 future.<br />
 <br />
 besides that, i'm usually concentrating on school and working out.
 i'm a 24 hour fitness member and i love it. i kick box, swim,
 dance, run, anything that gets my heart rate up. it's a great
 escape from school stress. that, and i've made a promise to myself
 that the only drug i'll ever allow myself to be addicted to is
 adrenaline. i figure it's gotta be more fun than being strung out
 on heroin.","eh, friday nights are usually all or nothing situations. i can go
 for the night on the town...dancing, heading to a ball game,
 movies, partying, hitting up the bar, or just hanging out with
 friends. i'm pretty open-minded about stuff and love having
 adventures.<br />
 <br />
 at the same time, i'm sometimes down for saying no to my friends in
 favor of the night in with family or alone...comfy pajamas and a
 good book, kickback watching sports and have a couple of beers, or
 netflix.","i'm a hanson fan. feel free to make fun of me for it.<br />

 catch, and here goes: if you're looking for a girly girl, sorry to
 disappoint. okay, i'm not really sorry. i'm strong willed, wild,

 color pink...what kind of girl hates pink, you ask? only the
 basically amazing ones. i'm competitive, fiesty, i don't take
 politely to being told to go make you a sandwich, and i don't plan
 on giving up my last name. don't like it? you're not the first and
 don't let the door hit ya on the way out.<br />
 <br />
 now, let's talk about you. here are some reasons you shouldn't
 message me...then we'll get to why you should. i won't give
 explanations to these...call me shallow, i call it being
 picky.<br />
 <br />
 1.) you're a picky eater.<br />
 <br />
 2.) you're a usc fan (okay, i was serious).<br />
 <br />
 3.) you're a liar. you suck, don't bother.<br />
 <br />
 4.) you spend the majority of your time playing video games, doing
 drugs, or any other activity that may result in you becoming fused
 with your couch. stop reading this right now, get off your
 computer, and go outside!<br />
 <br />
 okay, so if you've made it this far...here's why you should message
 me:<br />
 <br />
 1.) you're down to have spontaneous adventures and looking for a
 partner in crime.<br />
 <br />
 2.) you are dorky and can make me laugh. so, so hot.<br />
 <br />
 3.) you have blue or green eyes and dark hair. i'm a sucker for you
 already. 100 sexy points.<br />
 <br />
 3.) you have a goodreads account. you just earned yourself 100 sexy
 points.<br />
 <br />
 4.) you're thinking, ""gosh, will this girl message me back if i
 message her?"" well, since you made it past the above requirements,
 probably. i believe i've been slapped with one of those ""replies
 very selectively"" banners, but so long as your message consists of
 more substance than ""wanna see my cam?"" or ""hi, ur a hottie"", you
 should be fine. now, i suggest you go with my theory on life: nut
 up or shut up. do it."

 things into this world.<br />
 <br />
 i just said that with a straight face.<br />
 <br />
 i am a cross-culture geek-otaku, a connoisseur of oddities and a
 product of prolonged exposure to fiction. i am an artist and a
 gamer, and i hold deep passions for both. more than anything, i am
 a creator; i enjoy constructing ideas and giving them life through
 art, writing, or <a class=""ilink"" href=
 ""/interests?i=roleplay"">roleplay</a>. as such, it is my personal
 mission to bring awesome things into this world, and because of
 that i am driven by a craving for success.<br />
 <br />
 despite that, i am not a particularly deep person (at least, i
 don't like to think that i am). one might call me eccentric or
 whimsical. i enjoy cheap thrills as much as i enjoy grand epics. i
 make big deals out of little issues and take little issue with big
 deals. i can get enthusiastic and possibly wax poetic about the
 most inane, trivial things. it's also worth noting that i am
 notoriously perverted, a trait not-at-all hidden by my choice of
 artwork. don't worry, i can distinguish fiction from reality,
 otherwise i wouldn't be here.<br />
 <br />
 **disclaimer**<br />
 the personality matrix will tell you that i am ""more experienced in
 love"". do not believe it. my confession is as follows:<br />
 <br />
 i have not ""dated"" before, in a manner of speaking. i had a
 girlfriend once seven years ago, and nothing else since. i am
 pained but not shamed to admit that i am romantically starved. more
 than anything, i want someone to share my mind and heart with. i
 <em>almost</em> said that with a straight face.","in a word, ""floating"". i would say ""drifting"", but that would imply
 that i'm going somewhere, which i'm clearly not. i'm confined to a
 purgatory of circumstances, but i'm doing what i can to get
 by.<br />
 <br />
 i still live at my parents' house due to circumstance, not by
 choice, and i remain here by their good mercy. i'm unemployed, but
 do freelance work at home just to make a buck. i'm also hired by
 reverge labs as a contract cleanup artist for their indie 2d
 fighter, <em><a class=""ilink"" href=
 ""/interests?i=skullgirls"">skullgirls</a></em>. if i'm not drawing
 or working, i'm probably playing games or watching anime. i don't
 hate my life as it is right now, but i wish i had more.","i am a freelance illustrator with a focus in character design (and
 a penchant for nonsensically erotic costuming), pinups, and game
 art asset creation. i hold a bachelor of science degree for
 computer animation, and am trained traditionally in the art of
 animation. on our spare time, my brother and i make amateur
 animations that we upload to youtube under the studio name
 ""sugarpunch design works"". we've gathered quite a following, much
 to our surprise.<br />
 <br />
 beyond that, i am an avid gamer. i especially enjoy <a class=
 ""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=fighting%0agames"">fighting games</a> and
 <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=rpg"">rpg</a>s (my tastes lean
 towards eastern rpgs). i play fighting games at a ""hobbyist"" level;
 more dedicated than a 'casual' player, but not as hardcore as a
 tournament-level player. i have played <a class=""ilink"" href=
 ""/interests?i=league+of+legends"">league of legends</a> profusely
 for the past year and a half, and it is the only strategy game in
 which i claim some level of competence. i also play <a class=

 <a class=""ilink"" href=
 ""/interests?i=dungeons%0aand+dragons"">dungeons and dragons</a> with
 zeal, though i have not had a live session in the longest

 <br />
 though i have made no commercial attempts, i am also told that i am
 a skilled writer, by more than one person. i feel that writing goes
 hand in hand with character design, and i hope for a chance to put
 these talents together.<br />

 <br />
 until recently, i have maintained a hairstyle that could only be
 described as 'curtainlike'. purposely cut to be uneven, it is long
 in the front and unkempt just about everywhere else, but manages
 some odd sense of neatness. my hair is thick, voluminous, and easy
 to shape with minimal effort or upkeep. it is a point of pride for
 me to admit that more than one girl has expressed jealousy for my
 hair. within a month or two, my hair will return to its former
 glory.<br />
 <br />
 ""why is he in a suit?""<br />
 i make it a point to dress nicely in social occasions, when i can
 afford to. i am keenly aware that i'm not entirely pleasant to look
 at, so the least i can do is make the effort to dress nicer than i
 look. also, i dislike wearing denim, and you will never find me in
 a pair of jeans.<br />
 <br />
 ""holy crap what's wrong with your fingers.""<br />
 only slightly exaggerated, but my fingers do draw some degree of
 attention. there is hair growing on the first set of metacarpals
 beyond the knuckles, and this seems to shock people when they
 notice them. i am... actually somewhat embarrassed by this fact,
 but i make no effort to shave my fingers.","i'll admit, i'm not a very literary person. the words ""have you
 read?"" are lost on me more often than not. i've read more comics
 than actual novels, but there are a scant few that i've actually
 enjoyed. i'll list them below in no particular order.<br />
 <br />
 tales from underground (dostoyevsky)<br />
 hellsing (manga, kouta hirano)<br />
 the book of five rings (musashi)<br />
 sin city (comic, frank miller)<br />
 <br />
 i don't watch a lot of tv, and in the rare cases that i do, my
 favorite shows are usually cancelled.<br />

 <br />
 i've been somewhat disconnected from mainstream music, for various
 reasons. i usually enjoy soundtracks from my favorite games or
 anime, but i also enjoy classic rock. here's another completely
 scrambled list of my favorite bands and composers:<br />
 <br />
 shoji meguro (shin megami tensei series, persona series)<br />
 daisuke ishiwatari (guilty gear series, blazblue series)<br />
 zun (touhou series)<br />
 crow's claw (indie circle, japan)<br />
 demetori (indie circle, japan)<br />
 queen<br />
 ac/dc<br />
 van halen<br />
 <br />
 food... oh boy. i don't have any particular favorites, but i do
 enjoy just about everything with rare few exceptions. if i had to
 pick out favorites, i'd have to go with the rich, succulent flavor
 of gourmet seafood, or the powerful, filling flavor of good
 barbecue.<br />

 silence disturbs me. music moves me. the absence of motion is
 unsettling.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>fiction</strong><br />
 i'd normally single out 'anime' or 'games', but the truth is i just
 want to have some fiction to fall into. it doesn't have to be a
 grand sweeping epic, it can be simple and fun; it doesn't matter,
 as long as there's something to experience and explore.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>companionship</strong><br />
 i don't consider myself extroverted, nor do i consider myself
 introverted. all the same, being all alone is a frightening,
 frightening thought. i often get depressed when there's absolutely
 no one in the house except myself.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>art</strong><br />
 this might file under the 'fiction' section, but it has more to do
 with my own ability to create art rather than to experience it. as
 mentioned above, i love to create. it comes together with the other
 entries above: i love to absorb fiction, coalesce them into
 thought, create art, and share my creations with people.<br />
 <br />
 <strong>humor</strong><br />
 i don't consider myself a dreadfully serious person. i love to
 laugh, because... well, who doesn't?<br />
 <br />
 <strong>erotica</strong><br />
 it's worth mentioning a second time that i am notoriously
 perverted. i'm proud of my sexuality and make no secret of it. call
 me shallow if you must, but i idolize beauty and i don't hold
 myself back with some false sense of 'maturity'. if i think it's
 sexy, i'll call it as i see it.","no eloquent paragraphs this time, my thoughts aren't so clear-cut
 to me that i can write essays about them.<br />
 <br />
 much of my head is buried in games and fiction. if i'm not
 pondering story ideas or ludicrously sexy character designs, i'm
 probably thinking about game design, or some way to merge the two
 into a cohesive narrative experience. a lot of time is spent
 thinking about how to bridge the gap between western game design
 tropes and eastern game design tropes to make one multicultural
 awesome mega-game. the few times i'm not thinking of games or
 stories, i'm probably thinking about the future, which isn't always
 a positive experience. if nothing else, i also spend time thinking
 of how to make more money, or of my next self-appointed project,
 assuming i'm not already on one.","<a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=drawing"">drawing</a> or
 <a class=""ilink"" href=""/interests?i=gaming"">gaming</a>. the two
 activities comprise most of my daily life, so this isn't really
 exclusive to friday nights.","back in high school, i used to drape my hair over one eye. i wasn't
 emo or anything, i just wanted to have cool anime hair. then emo
 people stole it from me, so i had to resort to more reasonable
 hair. as a result, my left eye is actually more nearsighted than my
 right eye. no joke, it's on my prescription.<br />
 <br />
 fun fact: you actually can see through a curtain of hair over your
 eyes. the hair is close enough such that you can see between the
 strands.","you can tolerate frequent rants on western gaming culture vs
 eastern gaming culture, liberal distortion of the english language,

 learn!).<br />

 snowboarding (kirkwood!), dancing, yoga, sailing, running,
 climbing, or happy hour patio beer drinking, falling in love with

 i talk about snowboarding a lot, the road trips, making new friends
 on the lift, safety meetings, hot tubs, and writing ride reports
 for a soul riding website. but when it gets down to it this is what
 i mean when i talk about snowboarding:<br />
 <br />
 the feeling of floating, flying down steep knee-deep pow. the
 silence of snow in trees or sitting at the top of the world after a
 long hike. the awareness of being truly in the moment with
 quietness of mind. the dance of carving down the mountain slashing
 banks, surfing better than i've ever been able to on water. the
 success of finding untouched powder at the end of a long traverse.","not thinking, about living each day and staying present. taking
 time to smell the coffee and try to recall the unhurried pace of
 life that so many other cultures have managed to master","depends on saturday plans? usually happy hour somewhere or out with
 my friends, oak bike party once a month, exploring new bars in
 oakland and dancing. i'm also trending towards thursday and

 circus arts and spend a couple days a week taking classes focused
 on aerial skills (trapeze, fabric), acrobatics (tumbling, basing),
 flexibility and strength training. when i'm not swinging 20 feet

 something that just struck me (3/30/2012): to some extent, it's a
 shame how influential first impressions are on judgments about
 people. everyone - not just people on this site, and not just on
 the internet - has an incredible multiplicity of selves that come
 out in different situations. anytime i write a message or read a
 profile here, i am presenting or seeing only a tiny piece of
 personality. the reason this is a shame is because, even though all
 those tiny pieces are part of who i am and who other people are, i
 sometimes feel like i need to present one particular piece that's
 likely to get a response. the consequence of not doing so is
 sometimes never being able to show the rest of oneself, and never
 seeing more of whoever didn't like the piece that they saw. not
 feeling free to act silly, or serious, or sexy, or timid (not
 simultaneously, of course) is a strange feeling. i'm not saying
 that one shouldn't worry about making a good first impression -
 which is a very important skill - but i wonder how many more rich
 connections could be made if more could be shared.","saving the world of men from dangerous hellspawn<br />

 last night i took my first argentine tango lesson! jacqueline is
 this wonderful dancing buddah that teaches dance fusion at the pac.
 i took to her style of dance immediately. she mixes salsa, cha cha,
 and tango into the hour of dance, and i love it! just what the dr.
 ordered! thank you markus and dr. r. for bugging me! i have been
 reminded twice now, that dancing free style - like modern dance,
 unstructured would build some fire for me. i have been keeping
 dance fusion on my calendar for months now, trying to get it into
 my routine. i am slow to start something new, but once i make the
 commitment, i put more attention on it until it's integrated into
 my life. jacqueline has been an amazing match to what i have been
 looking for, and i found her with little effort! yay! so, this is
 what i learned about myself: hopefully, you can take some of this
 away for yourself.<br />
 <br />
 i learned that tango requires of me to be present. i have to be in
 the moment. i have to focus on staying in my circle, keeping my
 attention between me and my dance partner. don't look down. don't
 think!!! don't think!!! don't think!<br />
 i noticed that my feet were doing what they were suppose to be
 doing, as long as i stepped with the music, and kept walking. keep
 my frame centered face to face with my partner. as long as i was in
 the moment, and continued to stay with my partner and be present, i
 was ok. it was a strange feeling to be ""thoughtless""<br />
 <br />
 what i was doing, when i tried to think, was ""chase"" my partner. i
 was slightly delayed. how many times do i ""chase""<br />
 my goals?<br />
 <br />
 today, i forgot to come to work for one of my most favorite
 clients. my daughter mckenna stayed home in the morning because she
 has had a tummy ache for days. she just needed to sleep in a bit
 longer. i lost track of my routine after that. my favorite auntie
 (80+ years old) was visiting my mom for lunch and we both decided
 to meet her. it was a beautiful gathering, full of joy and
 laughter, and a beautiful sunny day! then we took a walk to the
 dance store to replace mckenna's shoes.<br />
 <br />
 i had this feeling that i needed to be at the shop! i kept thinking
 i have to be there, but i didn't even try to check my calendar! so,
 we went home. and, i got a phone call from my favorite client! i
 missed my appointment with her. she's forgiven me, and we're
 rescheduling for tomorrow, but, i still am upset with myself! right
 now, i am mentally punishing myself for not being aware! i was
 chasing something else. i was in the moment enjoying my auntie and
 my family, and i could have been on time for my client! but, i
 didn't use my calendar to check my own schedule. i'm irritated with
 myself that i didn't listen to my inner guidance! how silly of me
 to have a calendar if i don't use it! everything that doesn't allow
 me to use my tools that i make to keep myself organized, let me
 destroy and uncreate that! rwgbppansbb!!!<br />
 <br />
 3/21/2012 had my first argentine dance class last night! i learn
 more about myself when i take a class like that. how much am i able
 to be in present time? that's what it's all about in dance. that's
 what is all about in just about anything isn't it? i find it in my
 quilting, golf, yoga, just about anything really. being present is
 most valuable when being intimate with the one you love. ahh, what
 a sweet thought isn't it? i learned that i can easily let myself
 start thinking, which is the one thing you don't want to do with
 the argentine dance. you and your partner have to be in sync with
 the music. it's romantic, passionate, present! wow!! i am ready for
 more! did you happen to watch dancing with the stars monday night!
 it's going to be a good season! let me know if you are watching it
 too!<br />
 <br />
 3/12/2012 well, i am dancing now! i found this awesome dance class
 called dance fusion and jaqueline is this amazing and sexy dancer
 who's inspiring me to get my groove back! i've been taking pilates
 for a year and a half and my core is strong, but i was missing
 music in my life. yay! i am happy to fit this new hobby into my
 already full and active life! until i find my life-mate play-mate,
 i'll be keeping myself busy and happy doing fun things. how does it
 get better than this? and what else is possible?<br />
 <br />
 new post as of 2/24/2012. i have a craving to take up dancing
 again. dr. orders! i used to dance all the time. any kind of dance,
 i've tried it. i would like get back into salsa or swing. i am good
 at moving my body where i want it to go. maybe someone out there
 needs a good partner. i'm pretty good at following. if you are
 pretty experienced, and would like to help me brush up my steps,
 i'd be grateful!<br />

 i'm an old soul in a young body. it's taken me quite a long while
 to be comfortable to be in my own skin. i accept i am unique. i
 look younger than most women my age. i think younger. i am not set
 in my ways. i think i am open to new experiences, but with wisdom
 behind it. i push myself to open myself to new possibilities. i
 love to meet people who enjoy their life. i hope to meet like
 minded spirits who have defied the laws of nature, and bend time. i
 believe you don't have to buy into what society tries to promote. i
 want to surround myself with friends who know that they create
 their own reality. i challenge myself to break my own programmed
 thoughts that don't allow me to have a magnificent, magical life
 that i know we deserve to live. i stopped believing that life must
 be hard! i see evidence of it every day, when good things
 happen.<br />
 i've been creative always. danced, sing, art.<br />
 right now i stay fit by taking pilates 2-3 times a week. frankly, i
 am lazy when it comes to exercise. pilates is efficient, and gets

 when i was really young i thought i was going to be an artist. i
 painted in high school and was actually pretty good. i got an offer
 of admission to the pratt institute, but i wound up turning it down
 because i was dead set on becoming a cultural anthropologist
 instead. i was always (and still am) obsessed with archaeology, and
 for some reason that served as a path into cultural anthro.<br />
 <br />
 so i did that for a while. i majored in anthro in college, loved
 it, and always thought i'd wind up as a professor, but in the end i
 just couldn't handle the prospect of being yet another unemployed
 ph.d. in the world.<br />
 <br />
 so i went to law school instead (wtf, right?). i figured at least
 i'd have a steady income as a lawyer, and i could practice human
 rights law.<br />
 <br />
 i actually kind of like being a lawyer, even if it is a field
 largely populated by douchebags, and even if i am shackled to an
 absolutely crushing amount of educational debt. i got to spend some
 time in phnom penh working for the un-backed tribunal that's
 prosecuting the khmer rouge, and even though i'm currently working
 doing public health law, i think eventually i might want to find a
 way back into international criminal law (my ultimate, silly,
 childish dream would be to work on a team of lawyers that
 prosecutes bush and cheney ... sigh). i still have a lot of friends
 who work at the hague, maybe someday those connections will pay off
 for me.<br />

 course, it could also be something completely random and unrelated

 star wars, indiana jones, the godfather, woody allen, james bond
 movies (personally i'm a roger moore kinda guy) oliver stone,
 martin scorcese, so on and so forth.... unique dvds in my
 collection would probably include clue, cinema paradiso, scarface
 (1931), rebel without a cause, private parts, red dawn, shadow of
 the vampire, and waterworld. yes, waterworld.<br />
 <br />
 music: i'm a sucker for old punk rock, classic rock, and hair
 metal. yes, i said hair metal. my favs include, but aren't limited
 to, ramones, sex pistols, misfits, beatles, rolling stones, pink
 floyd, guns n roses, iron maiden, zeppelin, duran duran, bowie, and
 neil young, but i love to get down with my homies dre and weezy f.
 baby. i also like to sing middle-of-the-road songs like seal's
 'kiss from a rose', sinead o'conner's 'nothing compares 2 you', and
 rod stewart songs at inopportune and inappropriate times. still
 haven't done karaoke yet, but i'm certain that i would be a
 pleasant disaster.<br />
 <br />
 shows: don't watch a lot of tv, but i love community, family guy,
 daily show/colbert report, and this real goofy sci-fi show called
 eureka. whenever i watch the news, i hope that someone in the
 background will do something to make a scene or prank the reporter-
 i love howard stern sorta comedy, which naturally makes me a fan of
 prank calls and fart jokes.<br />
 <br />
 food: i will eat anything, i'm really not afraid of weird stuff. i
 love mexican, puerto rican, german, korean, russian, japanese,
 chinese, and italian. i like to eat healthy and try to eat
 vegetarian when possible, but i'm not totally committed to the
 idea.","my laptop, guitar, itunes, gym shorts, a good book, and beer in the

 with, who can laugh at my silly jokes and enjoy the off-the-wall
 things i like to do. if we turn out to be soul mates, then that's
 awesome, but there's no pressure. let's just have coffee together
 and see if we hit it off. then, we'll see what happens from there.
 not everybody out there enjoys doing the activities i have listed
 below, but it would be wonderful for me to go out with a woman who
 does enjoy these things. when you're with me, i don't mind if you
 erupt in enormous gales of laughter with streams of tears running
 down your face. i will always, ever the gentleman, be ready with a
 box of tissues. or, if you want to merely mildly chuckle, that's
 fine too.<br />
 <br />
 also, i am not looking for children. children are great, but
 they're just not for me.<br />
 <br />
 anyway, i think that i have a great sense of humor. i have a whole
 range of funny accents (well, at least some people think they're
 funny. you be the judge). i have a great obama and bush accent.
 but, please don't misunderstimate me. some of the things i like to
 do include exploring, walking, surfing the web (which might include
 trip planning, sometimes actual trips, sometimes wannabe
 trips),watching old 80s commercials on youtube, reminiscing, etc.","right now, i'm working at alcatraz in the cell house, handing out
 audio players, helping visitors to use the player, taking the
 players when they finish the tour, helping them find out such
 sundry questions like where is al capone's cell and where is the
 exit. it's pretty fun meeting people all over the world, although
 there are so many people that you don't get to ""meet"" them. it sure
 is a change from what i used to do before i got this job on march
 13th. i worked mainly as a data entry clerk in an office.","remembering movies. yes, i have a huge dvd collection that i have
 cultivated over the years.<br />
 <br />
 going to various restaurants throughout the city and the bay area,
 after researching them on yelp, of course. i have never written a
 yelp review, but if i did, i would say it would be pretty meh,
 although i never use that word.<br />

 song, then it's open season for my regaling you with said
 song).<br />

 knowing exactly what bus to take to go whatever random
 neighborhood/suburb you want to go to. so, you want go to napa on
 public transit? no problem. it's bart, vallejo transit then the
 vine bus. any other questions?","my off-beat charm, my knowledge of trivia, my great memory (like an
 elephant, i never forget). i love wikipedia and use that to further
 enhance my knowledge of everything from the history of the phrase
 ""lol,"" to the new york subway to the history of old computers.

 graduate, etc. etc. etc. for books, i like catcher in the rye by
 j.d. salinger and time and again and jack finney. also, i used to
 love stephen king when i was a kid. i read cujo eight times. food
 would be italian food, pizza, hamburgers (though i've got to stay
 away from that), german food (i miss schnitzel haus!), cheesecake,
 doritos, sour jack kids, sweet tarts, shock tarts (wanna watch an
 80s flick with a huge assortment of sour candy?), all manner of ice
 cream.","dvds.<br />

 that it often takes plastic surgery to remove it, which is kind of
 expensive.<br />

 higher.<br />

 billboards to graffiti to old cars to streetlights (old
 streetlights are gorgeous) to the meal at a restaurant right before
 i eat it.","thinking about how great it would be to relive the 80s. i want to
 wake up and listen to huey lewis and the news on my pre-digital
 clock radio, you know the ones with the flaps on them. interesting,
 because back in the 80s, i didn't listen to 80s music as much. i
 got into motown though and had a whole bunch of scratched up 45's
 that i listened to.","doing my thing, whether that be exploring, going to north beach, or
 simply relaxing and watching tv. i don't generally bar hop, because
 i don't have too many friends who like to bar hop, and i hate going
 to bars by myself.","i like chick flicks every so often. i actually liked mystic pizza
 and i thought titanic was great and sex and the city was a great
 movie, so if you want to drag me to a chick flick, you really
 wouldn't be dragging me. i don't know if i want to watch sisterhood
 of the traveling pants yet. i don't think i'm there yet. i do have
 limits.","you like me . . .you really, really like me!!! seriously though, if
 you think i'm an attractive guy, by all means, let me know. if

 just so all of you know, i am actually a biological male. i didn't
 put ""gay female"" to be a perverted douche who thinks lesbians are
 blonde, femmy, sorority broads who have naked pillow fights that
 always lead to hours of scissoring. no. i put ""gay female"" because
 unfortunately(for me) i've always been attracted to, and dated
 lesbians. i like my women androgynous, i like them in boy clothes,
 and a dash of sexual ambiguity. there just isn't really an option
 on okstupid for what i like. just to be clear though, i'm not
 really after a type, per se. i've dated a few feminine, high
 maintenance, straight girls too. i guess just be hot, haha.<br />

 my taste in women probably stems from being raised by nothing but
 women, lesbians, and gay men. if there was such a thing as a

 anything. i have to admit that i do the same. i will go to a
 profile, read it, realize there is one criteria that i don't fit
 and move on in fear of rejection. i just wish more people would at
 least say hi, or you sound cool, or you have a cute face, or at the
 very least tell me i look like the myth busters guy (i do get that
 a lot in public).<br />
 <br />
 well, i'm not really sensitive. i just figured i would play with
 aliteration in my description.<br />
 <br />
 i love to travel, check out art usually at a smaller gallery rather
 than at a museum, music, especially live music, cooking, camping,
 hiking, exploring the city, and enjoying good food with
 friends.<br />
 <br />
 i also love me some heavily tattooed women. i love tattoos myself
 and just haven't gotten a ton yet. i just have one. i do plan a few
 more over the next couple of years. in fact i know what i want for
 both sleeves, completely different designs and plan to start the
 1st one, the colorful one in the next few months. this one will be
 a japanese design. the other one will look like native american
 (not tribal). if you saw the film ""the fountain"" it will be modeled
 after the one in that.<br />
 <br />
 the type of woman that i typically like is a pretty broad range. i
 love the girl next door look, but i also love women who have a bit
 of an edge to their look. i am predominantly attracted to brunettes
 and redheads, i love hispanic and pacific islander women, blue and
 green eyes, tattoos, piercings, etc. i also tend to like women with
 curves. now, personality is so much more important, so please feel
 free to reach out to me if you find me interesting. looks are only
 a small part of things and looks fade over time, but a personality
 is always there.<br />
 <br />
 from my facebook profile:<br />
 i am a walking contradiction. although i believe in the teachings
 of karl marx i work in the most capitalistic industry in the world,
 advertising. there are other things as well that my friends could
 expand upon.<br />
 i like the avant garde, mind expansion, counterculture, world
 religions, social contract theory, ecology, and climate
 change.<br />
 <br />
 i am smart, sarcastic, and sensitive.","i just recently moved back to the east bay from sf (alameda) and am
 trying to reconnect here. i have a feeling it will be a stepping
 stone as my goal is to get back to the city. i work in advertising
 and love it. i love being surrounded by intelligent and creative
 people. i am always looking to expand on my knowledge and have been
 contemplating either taking a few classes here and there that focus
 on photoshop and illustrator so that i can eventually get into the
 creative side of advertising or i have been thinking about going
 back to get my mba or law degree.<br />
 <br />
 i also am interested in community planning and development and
 would love to get more involved in my community to try to improve
 it for everyone. try to work on a sustainable plan to help the
 homeless since no one seems to care about them. i saw a girl the
 other day who just looked like she was fairly new to the streets
 and i talked with her and she had just lost her job, her
 unemployment wasn't enough to cover her rent so she was evicted. i
 just wonder how long it will be until she succumbs to drug
 addiction.","having fun and not taking myself too seriously. i am also good with
 numbers, as i better be since i am an analyst.","my eyes, glasses, and hair color.","from my facebook profile:<br />

 what could be better?***<br />
 <br />
 i spend my time wondering why we all act the way we do. sometimes,
 i feel as if the whole of my life has flown in the face of who i
 should be or what i should supposedly enjoy. i'm peaceful, but i've
 been to two different wars. i prefer to do the listening, but i'm a
 passionate writer with great ambitions. i can talk to you about
 videogames for hours, but the thing that relaxes me the most is
 running for miles. i don't place a lot of value in who a person is
 on the surface, but man, i can't seem to pry myself out of the
 buckle. i've never had much of a family, but i love the one i
 have.<br />
 <br />
 i'm fortunate that i've gained the perspective i need to realize
 how lucky i've been in life.<br />
 <br />
 i spent eight years in the air force, flying on jets and trying to
 catch osama bin carmen sandiego. i'm an inactive reservist now, but
 i got to keep all the great war stories and the comfy flight suits.
 after that was finished, san francisco was the only place i wanted
 to be. i packed my stuff into my car and drove across the country
 to my new home.<br />
 <br />
 i've lived in a lot of places, now - michigan, vermont, alaska,
 arizona, florida, and nebraska. each time, i've taken pieces of
 where i've been and learned all that i could before moving on.
 people are different everywhere you go, but the melting pot of the
 bay area lets all kinds of people live in the same place, and
 that's why i love it so much.<br />
 <br />
 i am always listening, always learning, and i love getting to know
 new people. i travel whenever possible, enjoy pretentious nights
 out on the town, and drive entirely too fast...being a flyboy
 didn't help.<br />
 <br />
 i was also a zookeeper. that's important, too.","working in the city for the summer, then moving on to the east cost
 come september or october. before i go, i'm making a lifetime of
 memories. we are all stories in the end.","morse code. (see the 'other' under languages i speak?)<br />
 <br />
 i love deciphering the way we communicate with each other as human
 beings, including ourselves. i specialize in showing you what your
 interpersonal relationships are saying about you as a person. it's
 free for the first session - after that, you owe me dinner.<br />
 <br />
 i'm good at a lot of things; trivia, being considerate of others,
 and dressing myself. i will challenge your preconceptions and make
 you laugh while i'm doing it. i appreciate a witty, sarcastic sense
 of humor - i can take whatever you dish out, and i hope you can
 take it right back.<br />
 <br />
 i will either amaze you with my encyclopedic and endless knowledge
 about seemingly everything, or i will make you laugh at my apparent
 alzheimer's disease. no, seriously, do you remember the
 conversation we had before we left to go play laser-tag? i was
 walking around twenty minutes later asking people if they'd seen
 you in the last couple hours.<br />
 <br />
 you know, it's probably because the rest of my brain is taken up
 with the titles of star trek episodes.","it's my smile and the dimples that go with it. after that, probably
 my angular jawline. i'm a product of german engineering.","this is hardly an all-inclusive list.<br />
 <br />
 some authors i like: ernest hemingway. alexandre dumas. michael
 crichton. orson scott card. jules verne. you should read ayn rand,
 as long as you don't turn into a douche in the process.<br />
 <br />
 some films you should see: schindler's list. magnolia. gentlemen
 prefer blondes. scott pilgrim versus the world. casablanca. singing
 in the rain. zombieland. mean girls.<br />
 <br />
 some stuff you should watch: shoujo kakumei utena. battlestar
 galactica. arrested development. (i am not that guy you know who
 flips out over arrested development, don't worry.) firefly. avatar.
 the unit. jericho. the tudors. mythbusters. the discovery
 channel.<br />
 <br />
 the music i like: kara dioguardi and anyone she's written for. any
 classic rock or southern rock, especially the eagles. platinum
 weird. goo goo dolls. the script. natalie imbruglia. paramore.
 ellie goulding. oasis. katy perry. matchbox 20. yellowcard. gin
 blossoms. third eye blind. train. our lady peace. tonic. jackson
 browne. the guys who came up with the george washington rap.<br />
 <br />
 games you should play: xenogears. (this list could just start and
 end with xenogears, let's be real.) final fantasy vi. super
 metroid. dead space. odin sphere. mario kart. kingdom hearts.
 half-life. borderlands. mass effect. dragon age. resident evil.
 zelda. i am the greatest megaman x player on this planet. you
 should be a nice person and sell me your copy of suikoden ii.","1) freedom. look, maslow, you're not invited to this
 conversation.<br />
 2) being outside. go away, cloudy day.<br />
 3) new experiences, new people, new places.<br />
 4) culture. i'm talking live jazz, theater, good food.<br />
 5) the quiet of total solitude.<br />
 6) laughter. lots of it.","where america is going with its foreign policy. how to fix domestic

 the truth about cats and dogs. i love you, but you need to
 stop.<br />
 <br />
 if you are, in fact, janeane garofalo, i must apologize. you are a
 lovely actress and comedienne. wikipedia tells me that you hated
 your time on saturday night live - bummer, brosef.","probably doing something ridiculous. look, if you're going to hang
 out with me, you could be subject to any number of unusual
 activities that i claim full responsibility for:<br />
 <br />
 - super nintendo tournament to compete for a burger king
 crown<br />
 - dressing up as cowboys and going to texas roadhouse<br />
 - having a photography scavenger hunt downtown<br />
 - full-contact miniature golf<br />
 - getting a whole bunch of booze and watching every uwe boll movie
 back-to-back<br />
 - hitting the town for a dressed-up, classy evening; the kind that
 you see other people on and wonder what they're up to<br />
 - camping...again, with a whole bunch of booze<br />
 - attending a fire-wielding bellydance and snake-slinging burlesque
 show dressed like time-travelers from the twenties<br />
 - conducting dramatic readings from an issue of cosmopolitan<br />
 - going to a baseball game and making people laugh with my creative
 heckling<br />
 - cooking a delicious dinner with friends out of whatever we have
 lying around while listening to the my fair lady obc recording on
 vinyl<br />
 - arranging for everyone to have giant bowls of captain crunch
 while watching tarantino flicks<br />
 <br />
 you've been warned. of course, if this all sounds like a grand ol'
 time to you, we'll probably get along just peachy.","i'm incredibly understanding, but bad grammar and spelling make me
 cringe like nails on a chalkboard.<br />
 <br />
 i'm a very logical person, so it can be difficult to get me to open
 up beyond my social exterior.<br />
 <br />
 i like kelly clarkson, she's a badass. you can't rain on this
 parade.<br />

 my friend daisy adds, ""you have a ten-year-old taiwanese prostitute
 in your basement."" i'm reasonably certain that's not true.","you're beautiful, intelligent, witty, and kind. make me laugh, and
 i'll make you laugh back. don't get mad if i pick you up and throw
 you in a lake, you had it coming.<br />

 watch scott pilgrim on a couch. if you think that's a terrible
 idea, you've probably just never tried it.<br />
 <br />
 i'd like to get to know you, but please, send me a message that
 doesn't look like you sent the same thing to a whole bunch of other

 -open with 'thick and vanilla, a combo i can do with'.<br />
 -expound on the attractive qualities of women who do not resemble

 -tell you that, ""you remind me of someone i know except sexier and
 available.""<br />
 -pretend that i kissed you...and then tell you how good it was for
 me.<br />
 -high-five you in the chest, because i love how much you love
 birds.<br />
 -show up where you work, because you won't call me.<br />
 -chase you across the street from the restaurant, swearing
 profusely at you until you hide in a flock of

 a bit of a homebody, this internet thing seems like the wise option
 to try. i am a former buffalonian, so if you know the terms ""wide
 right"" or ""no goal"", we can cast each other knowing glances and
 shake our heads in collective shame. while i can never reform
 darwinian-imprinted sarcasm as a primary means of communication, i
 can admit that places that do not freeze in winter might actually
 be decent homes for hockey clubs. i can also tell you which english
 monarch authored the magna carta, and which grape was the genetic
 precursor to zinfandel. i'm an extrovert, but somehow since i
 turned 30 the homing instinct took over and now all that ""stuff""

 my wildly exciting trips to the dog park or the grocery store so i

 <br />
 what i'm hoping for: i want a man i can laugh with daily. we have
 similar hobbies, interests, habits. we get our humor and each
 other. we communicate by mind-meld. and since mind-meld is not
 really a method of communication, we are willing to talk about
 stuff, no matter how tough it may be. when we get into an argument
 (however rare), we are able to push through it to a resolution that
 leads to kissing and heading to bed. thoughtfulness is important
 (leaving the toilet seat up), and integrity is key. i want a
 partner: one who knows himself, can manage his life, has his
 directions and pursuits, can spell and use grammar with aplomb, is
 willing to give 110% to this relationship if it's worth working as
 i will, and loves my four-legged snorty, farty quadruped as much as
 i do. we don't need to agree on everything, but we can be willing
 to have each other push boundaries, and help us be better partners
 to each other. if you have nerdy, intellectual pursuits like 18th
 century british literature, stamp collecting or entymology, i might
 already be melting","i work as a college professor and in healthcare. i volunteer a lot

 way it moves on them when we go dancing, who loves the ocean and
 thinks that we are so lucky to be surrounded by it. someone who
 loves live music, good food, and is up for a walk even though a cab
 would be faster (don't worry if your in heels, we are calling the
 cab). she comes up with her own ideas of what we should do or
 explore together. i want someone who has her stuff together, is
 finished school, has a job, is independent and on her own two
 feet.<br />

 times a week even though they are 3k miles away, and hers should be
 important to her as well.<br />

 i'm accidentally funny. i can be clever and witty, but i think most
 of my friends think i'm fun to wind up and let go. i'm passionate

 about it, if every song on your playlist has a story, a memory, and
 an emotion, then we'll be off to a good start. i'm a nerd. i'm an
 information sponge. i'm a sports fan. i'll scream with blood lust
 watching a good hockey fight, and then be just as comfortable and
 happy at an art exhibit or a musical. i love good design, good
 engineering, and anything that takes thought, care, creativity and
 skill. i'm still working on my cooking (my baking is pretty good -
 especially my kugel!), but i can eat like it's a sport. i laugh at

 highbrow. i'm a romantic.","i help silicon valley continue to be the most innovative,

 things, building computers, making people think, asking interesting

 here and there.","my friends tell me i'm very animated with a highly expressive face,

 it's worth reading, it is probably online. by the time it makes the
 printed page it's old news. there are some exceptions in the
 nonfiction section. i love a good story, but if i'm going to invest
 time in a book i want information, not imagination. once in a while
 i'll treat myself to a novel, and there are some classics that are
 on my reading list. first up: dante's divine comedy. i do like book
 lovers! i can be converted!<br />
